# Example GraphQL Service

This module provides services/utilities for interacting with our Example API.
The main tool you'll use in the project is the `GraphQLService` class which allows
you to make requests to that GraphQL API. Additionally, you can access the
`GraphQLService` service in your components using the `useExampleAPI` hook.
