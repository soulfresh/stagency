### Customized Header

It's possible to customize the next and previous buttons in the header
by passing the `renderNext` and `renderPrevious` props.

In the following example, the next and previous areas have been customized to
provide cancel and save functions. In order to navigate through the flow, next
and previous buttons are placed inside the children render prop. Those buttons
call the `onNext` and `onPrevious` props received by children to move through
the flow. If you pass data to those callbacks, it will be collected and passed
through to your children prop on the next render.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-progress-multistepflow--custom-header" />
</Canvas>

### Controlled Component

You can use `MultistepFlow` as a controlled component by passing
the `index` and `setIndex` props.

<Canvas>
  <Story id="components-progress-multistepflow--controlled" />
</Canvas>
